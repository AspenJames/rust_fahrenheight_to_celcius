## Execution 

### Install Rust

You must have Rust installed on your machine in order to run this program. You can find instructions on how to install Rust on your machine [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html).

Confirm you have properly installed Rust by restarting your terminal and executing the following command:

`rustc --version`

The output should be in the following format:  `rustc x.xx.x ([commit hash] [date])`

The `x.xx.x` represents your Rust version and the commit hash and date of latest release is within the parentheses. If this command fails, the installation was not successful. Attempt installation by an [alternate method](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/other-installers.html).

### Fork and Clone

After you have confirmed your installation of Rust, fork and clone this repository onto your machine. `cd` into the program directory and run with `cargo run`.
